            <p>But, O my people, 
               beware lest there shall arise contentions among you, 
               and ye list to obey the evil spirit, which was spoken of by my father Mosiah.

            <h2>2 Nephi 2:5</h2>
            <p>And men are instructed sufficiently that they know good from evil. 
               And the law is given unto men. And by the law no flesh is justified; 
               or, by the law men are cut off. Yea, by the temporal law they were cut off; a
               nd also, by the spiritual law they perish from that which is good, and become miserable forever.
